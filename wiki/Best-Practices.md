As a host:

- Host the Q & A session in a designated Teams channel or chat: To keep things organized and clean, you should create the event in a particular channel or chat used for Q & A’s. This will ensure the app does not get lost in other conversations. Consider creating an event on Teams which will automatically generate a new chat for your group.
- Restrict your Q & A event to no more than one hour: Attendees will most likely not be willing to spend more than this duration at a live Q & A event.
- Prioritize answering the top-of-mind questions: You should always aim to answer the questions with the most upvotes as individuals are most concerned about these questions.

As an attendee:

- Check the leaderboard prior to asking a question: Another attendee may have already asked the question you were planning to submit. Instead of asking the same question again, simply leverage the upvoting feature.
- View the updates from the main card: If you’re hoping to view a simplified version of the leaderboard, consider checking the main card which is updated proactively and provides top questions and general updates.
